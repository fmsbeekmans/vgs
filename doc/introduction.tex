\section{Introduction}
With the explosion of data industry has set it's sight on distributed
computing to tackle their data processing problems.

Yet this is a field with many unsolved, and unsolvable problems.
However consumers just expect their service to work, distributed or
not.
WantDS BV wants to change their grid simulation itself to be
distributed. 
This document describes the process of designing, developing and
evaluating such a system.
Section 2 details the requirements of the proposed Virtual Grid
System (VGS).
Section 3 discusses the considered designs and compares their
respective merrits and flaws.
Section 4 shows the results of the experiments conducted to evaluate
the system.
