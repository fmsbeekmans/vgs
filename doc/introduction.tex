\section{Introduction}
Could you please add the proper names, course title, instructors... as on the lab report and fix the margins? I am afraid I am not so familiar with LaTEX.
\\\\
It would be nice if you could detail a little bit more the architecture of the system I just explained the fault tolerance mechanism but I have to leave now.
\\\
I wouldn't worry about the figure by now but I think we should include a drawing or something. It can guide us through the developing. The more detailed we have the system overview the easier will for developing.
\\\\ 
Once you do the modifications and feedback I will have a quick meeting with the TA to validate the design and later we will start the implementation.
\\\\
Have a nice day!
